Succulent plants may store water in various structures, such as leaves and stems. The water content of some succulent organs can get up to 90–95%. Most succulents have deep or broad root systems and are native to either deserts or regions that have a semiarid season. Succulent plants are found in more than 60 plant families, with members of Aizoaceae, Cactaceae, and Crassulaceae being dominantly succulent.'

    desc: 'A cactus is a great addition to the home thanks to its striking shape, size and flowers. Seeing as no cactus plant is the same, this houseplant is a unique, decorative way to add interest to your living space, whether it is perched on your windowsill or styled on a shelf. For plant lovers, a cactus is perfect for the less green-fingered as you only need to water moderately – in fact, it is actually better to underwater than it is to overwater. Although slow-growing, a cactus plant is fairly self-sustaining as it stores moisture in its roots, leaves and stems, and so largely regulates its own food intake. A cactus plant likes a light, airy and warm spot – but not too hot, around 18°C is ideal – and can cope well in direct sunlight.'

    name:'Mint',
    id: '9',
    cover: plant9,
    desc: 'Herbs can be grown indoors, and mint is one of them. However, mint (or any other herb) growing indoors can’t grow as vigorously as outdoors. Growing mint indoors is rewarding, it complements vegetables, salads, yogurt, and meat, and freshly picked leaves taste so great. Also, if you want to make an Indoor Herb Garden, mint is the best herb to begin with. Mint can tolerate some shade outside, but it needs a minimum of 3-4 hours of direct sunlight to grow well. Quality potting mix that is light and soilless is what you need to grow mint indoors. Mint loves moist soil, remember moist soil not overly wet.'

    id: '10',
    cover: plant10,
    desc: 'While basil is a commonly grown herb outdoors, this easy-care plant can also be grown indoors. In fact, you can grow basil inside much the same as you would in the garden. Container grown basil should be planted in well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Using the proper soil type is important in order to successfully grow basil inside. As basil is not tolerant of water stress, make sure pots provide adequate drainage. While the soil should be kept somewhat moist, it should never be soggy; otherwise, the roots will be prone to rotting.'
